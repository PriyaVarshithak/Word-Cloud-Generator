# Word-Cloud-Generator
This repository contains a Python implementation of a word cloud generator, a popular visual representation technique used to display keyword metadata or visualize free-form text. Leveraging libraries such as NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and matplotlib, this project preprocesses textual data and generates visually appealing word clouds.
